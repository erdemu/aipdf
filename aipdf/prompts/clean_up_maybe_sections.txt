Please process the following list of potential chapter names from a scientific paper. The list may contain items that are not chapter names, such as author names. 
Carefully remove any items that do not resemble chapter names. Ensure that key chapters such as the abstract, references, and conclusion are retained in the final output. 
Present the cleaned list in a JSON array format without any markdown syntax like '```json'. 

Example: 

The original list is as follows:

1. Introduction
John Doe
Jackie Chan
Xuan Wei et. al.
2. Methodology
3.2 Data Analysis
IV References
Conclusion
figure 2.3

In this example, 'John Doe', 'Jackie Chan' and 'Xuan Wei' are author names and should be removed. Additionally, 'figure 2.3' is a name for a figure inside of the document and thus it should also be removed.
With this analysis, then the expected output then would only be:

[
    "1. Introduction",
    "2. Methodology",
    "3.2 Data Analysis",
    "IV References",
    "Conclusion"
]

Note: Only remove an item if you are certain it is not a chapter name.
